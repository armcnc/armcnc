# ARMCNC BACKEND

⚡ Develop and compile the backend service ⚡

## Environment requirements

Golang: go1.22.0+

## Secondary Development

> We do not recommend running and debugging the program on your local computer. However, you can set up the necessary development environment locally for coding. When debugging and testing are needed, upload the code to the Ubuntu platform for execution.

## Compile and build

> You only need to ensure the correctness of the code after secondary development. When generating the deb installation file on Ubuntu, the backend executable will be automatically compiled and generated for you, so there’s no need to worry about this process.
